# SocketIOPlayground

Welcome to SocketPlayground, a learning repository dedicated to exploring the fundamentals of Socket.IO!

## Introduction

SocketPlayground is a place where you can dive deep into Socket.IO and gain hands-on experience with its key features and concepts. Whether you're new to Socket.IO or looking to expand your knowledge, this project provides a playground for you to experiment and learn.

## What Did I Learn?

By creating SocketPlayground repository, I have acquired fundamental knowledge of these concepts and features:

- **Socket Communication**: Learn how to establish and manage socket connections between clients and servers.
- **Event Emission**: Explore the `emit()` function to send custom events from the server to the clients.
- **Targeted Emission**: Discover how to use `to().emit()` to send events to specific clients or rooms.
- **Broadcasting**: Understand the concept of broadcasting and how to use `broadcast.emit()` to send events to all connected clients except the sender.
- **Event Handling**: Learn how to handle incoming events on the server using the `on()` function.
- **Special Events**: Dive into the "connection" and "disconnect" events, which are triggered when clients connect or disconnect from the server.
- **Middleware**: Explore the `io.use()` function to implement middleware for Socket.IO.

## Getting Started

To get started with SocketPlayground, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the server by running `npm start`.
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
5. Start experimenting with Socket.IO by modifying the code in the `server.js` file.
